1> what is meta Tag and how it works?
   Ans:The "meta" is info in the head.
        The <meta> tag defines metadata about an HTML document. Metadata is data (information) about data. 
       charset = character set utf-8 is character encoding capable of encoding all characters on the web.
        UTF-8 - Character encoding for Unicode.
       ISO-8859-1 - Character encoding for the Latin alphabetIt replaced ascii as the default character encoding.
       Because it is the default all modern browsers will use utf-8 without being explicitly told to do so.
       It remains in meta data as a common good practice.
          Example: <!DOCTYPE html>
                           <html>
                             <head>
                              <meta charset="UTF-8">
                             </head>
                             <body>
                               <h1>My Website</h1>
                                <p>Some text...</p>
                              </body>
                             </html>
2>What is breakPoint?
    ans:Due to the fact that Bootstrap is certainly built to get mobile first, we use a number of media queries to design sensible breakpoints for styles and interfaces .
 These Bootstrap Breakpoints Grid are typically based on minimum viewport widths and enable us to graduate up elements when the viewport changes.
Bootstrap mostly makes use of the following media query extends-- or breakpoints-- in source Sass documents for layout, grid system, and components.
